          Project Introduction:
        </strong> Pipeline to Success Homepage Redesign</h2>
        <p class="introduction__text">
          Pipeline to Success is a student-driven organization based at the University of Guelph, dedicated to bridging the gap between university life and future career opportunities. Their primary mission is to provide students with career-relevant experiences, skills, and knowledge through a variety of tailored programs and services. The organization operates with a strong commitment to integrity, collaboration, and growth, both for the students they serve and their own team members.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction__text">To achieve these objectives, Pipeline to Success offers several core programs:</p>
       <div class="introduction-grid">
        <ul class="introduction__list">
          <li class="introduction__list-item"><strong>Pipeline to Clinical Experience:</strong> Connecting students to valuable clinical volunteering opportunities, easing administrative burdens for clinics, and fostering meaningful partnerships.</li>
          <li class="introduction__list-item"><strong>Pipeline to Research:</strong> Providing students with access to lab positions and serving as a platform where professors can find qualified students for their research projects.</li>
          <li class="introduction__list-item"><strong>MCAT@Guelph:</strong> Offering structured preparation sessions for students planning to take the MCAT.</li>
        </ul>
       </div>
      
        <p class="introduction__text">
          For this project, the Pipeline to Success team sought a redesign of their homepage to better reflect their goals and values, provide clear navigation to their various programs, and create a more engaging user experience. The goal was to design a clean, user-friendly interface that captures the essence of their mission and enhances the accessibility of information, news, and updates for their diverse audience, including university students, employers, professors, and clinics.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction__text">
          As part of the redesign, I focused on creating a visually cohesive layout that aligns with their brand identity, incorporating elements that emphasize their core values of service, growth, and integrity. The redesigned homepage now serves as a dynamic hub for students to explore opportunities and for stakeholders to connect with talented individuals.

        <p class="problem-statement__text">
          The old design of the "Pipeline to Success" website presented several challenges that affected user engagement and navigation. The primary issues were:
        </p>
        <ul class="problem-statement__list">
          <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
            <strong>Cluttered Navigation:</strong> The disorganized layout made it difficult for users to find important information, with each section split into separate HTML documents, resulting in a fragmented and confusing user journey.
          </li>
          
          <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
            <strong>Absence of Visual Cues and Community Connection:</strong> The lack of images, icons, and visual elements made the website feel cold and uninviting. Without relatable visuals, such as images of students, campus life, or university landmarks, the site failed to foster a sense of community, leaving it feeling empty and disconnected.
          </li>
          
          <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
            <strong>Lack of Visual Hierarchy:</strong> The text-heavy design buried key content, making it hard for users to quickly understand and navigate the information presented.
          </li>
          
          <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
            <strong>Poor User Engagement:</strong> The absence of interactive elements left users without incentives to explore further, resulting in low engagement and minimal action-taking on the site.

            <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
              <strong>Simplified Navigation:</strong> Streamlining the menu structure into a unified, single-page application to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, eliminating the need to jump between multiple HTML documents.
            </li>
            
            <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
              <strong>Enhanced Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Implementing clear headings, subheadings, and strategically placed visual elements to highlight key content, making information easy to scan and understand at a glance.
            </li>
            
            <li class="problem-statement__list-item">

      <strong>Semantic HTML Structure:</strong> The website's structure was updated with semantic HTML tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, which improve the document's readability for screen readers and assistive technologies.
    </li>
    <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
      <strong>ARIA Roles and Attributes:</strong> ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes were added to interactive elements, such as buttons and navigation menus, providing additional context and functionality for users relying on screen readers.
    </li>
    <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
      <strong>Keyboard Navigation Support:</strong> The redesigned website ensures full keyboard accessibility, allowing users to navigate through interactive elements using the tab, enter, and arrow keys. This is particularly important for users with motor impairments.
    </li>
    <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
      <strong>Color Contrast and Readability:</strong> A high-contrast color scheme was implemented to improve text readability for users with visual impairments, ensuring compliance with WCAG contrast ratio requirements. I ensured that all text and interactive elements meet a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1, with large text achieving at least a 3:1 contrast ratio, enhancing readability and accessibility for users with visual impairments.

      <strong>Alt Text for Images:</strong> Meaningful and descriptive alt texts were added to all images, providing detailed descriptions for users who rely on screen readers or have images disabled.

    <li class="problem-statement__list-item">
      <strong>Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> The website was optimized to be fully responsive, ensuring accessibility across various screen sizes and devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
